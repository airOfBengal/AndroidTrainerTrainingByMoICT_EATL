    /*  Problem 1 : Write a program that prompts the user to enter 
    two positive integers and finds their greatest common divisor.  
    Solution:  Suppose you enter two integers 4 and 2, their greatest 
    common divisor is 2. Suppose you enter two integers 16 and 24, 
    their greatest common divisor is 8. So, how do you find the 
    greatest common divisor? Let the two input integers be n1 and n2. 
    You know number 1 is a common divisor, but it may not be the 
    greatest commons divisor. So you can check whether 
    k (for k = 2, 3, 4, and so on) is a common divisor for 
    n1 and n2, until k is greater than n1 or n2.

     /*  Problem 2 : Write a program that displays the first 50 
     prime numbers in five lines, each of which contains 10 
     numbers. An integer greater than 1 is prime if its only 
     positive divisor is 1 or itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 
     are prime numbers, but 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not. 
     Solution: The problem can be broken into the following tasks: 
     For number = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., test whether the number is prime. 
     Determine whether a given number is prime. Count the prime numbers. 
     Print each prime number, and print 10 numbers per line.
